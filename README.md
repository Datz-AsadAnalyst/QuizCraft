# QuizCraft 🧠 — Your Intelligent C++ Learning Companion


QuizCraft is the evolution of LevelUP — a simple quiz game turned into a smart, interactive, and gamified learning engine for C++ programming. It offers three learning levels, instant feedback, and rule-based code evaluation, making it perfect for learners of all stages.

  > 👇 This builds on the original LevelUp project.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎮 Multi-Level Gamified Learning
- **Beginner**: Introduction to basic concepts.
- **Intermediate**: Logic and structure challenges.
- **Advanced**: Real code evaluation with strict rule checking.

Every incorrect answer gives you:
- 🔁 Option to **Retry** (new randomized questions)
- 📘 Option to follow a **Learning Path**

---

### 🧠 Smart Code Checker (Advanced Level)
Instead of matching code files directly, EduComp uses a **rule-based evaluator**. Current example rules include:
- ✅ Every code line must end with a semicolon.
- ✅ Variables must start with an alphabet.
- ✅ Essential libraries like `<iostream>` must be included.

These rules are fully customizable!

---

### 🏗️ Built with OOP for Scalability
QuizCraft’s architecture is fully modular and object-oriented:
- Encapsulated logic per module
- Cleaner structure
- Easier to maintain and extend

---

### 📦 Easily Extendable Question System
- Input questions via text files
- Separate by difficulty level
- Easy to localize or update
